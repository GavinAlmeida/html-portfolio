<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 21 years old. I have a passionate for designing websites as a front end developer.
  I also am very active and love hiking, going to the gym, boxing, and playing basketball.
</p>

<p>I began coding about 3 years ago after high school when I realized I wanted to work in a field where I can let
  my creativity show.
</p>

<p>I also love traveling. My goal is to visit every country one day and really experience the true freedom that lies within
  discovering new places.
